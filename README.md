## ca-web

### a space to learn about web applications

This repository is developed to help SRC students to better understand the process of web applications and application development.

ITS CAs contribute to the 'ca-web' web application during their time on shifts.  CAs working during library shifts help to define and achieve goals with respect to site creation, development and content management.

CA tasks will be assigned and managed primarily via our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/src-its/ca-web/wiki/). ITS also maintains a [Google spreadsheet with task assignments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11RLaTHYF4iGLeoE_8zSLclmo9oeqn0KDi4CKvMPRQyE/edit#gid=0) for CA reference.
