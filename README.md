## ca-web

### [a space to learn](https://github.com/src-its/ca-web/wiki) about web applications

This repository is developed to help SRC students to better understand the process of web applications and application development.

ITS CAs contribute to the 'ca-web' web application during their time on shifts.  CAs working during library shifts help to define and achieve goals with respect to site creation, development and content management.

CA tasks will be assigned and managed primarily via our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/src-its/ca-web/wiki/). ITS also maintains a [Google spreadsheet with task assignments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11RLaTHYF4iGLeoE_8zSLclmo9oeqn0KDi4CKvMPRQyE/edit#gid=0) for CA reference.

## 2016 Initiative


Starting in 2016, SRC CAs are collaborating to develop a basic web application called **'django-ca'**.

This web application hosts a variety of content&mdash;written text, images, video, and other forms of media.

CAs must elect to work primarily in one of two teams:


### Development Team

The development team is responsibile for building and modifying the web application framework to meet ITS specifications.  This includes coding to extend and customize the core application (such as changing the formatting language used for page creation) as well as install and modify its theme and user interfaces (UI).

The development team will work with the [Django web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

Each CA wishing to contribute to the development team must build and work with a testing / development environment.  ITS will maintain an Ubuntu Linux 14.04 virtual machine that can be locally deployed and managed on CA computers.  Where CAs do not have access to a personal computer, there will be an option to utilize a computer at ITS for development and testing. All CA contributions must be pushed to GitHub prior to the end of each shift.

For information about '[getting started](https://github.com/src-its/ca-help/wiki/Development-Team-%7C-Getting-Started)' on the SRC-ITS development team, [check out our wiki](https://github.com/src-its/ca-help/wiki/Development-Team-%7C-Getting-Started)!



### Content Team

The content team is responsible for composing and publishing informational resources. CAs on the content team are also responsible for proofreading, editing, fact-checking and extending resources drafted by the development team.

CAs working on the content team must learn to use [both Git and GitHub](https://github.com/src-its/ca-web/blob/master/content/git-vs-github.md). Tasks will be opened, assigned and completed using the GitHub ticketing system.  CA contributions must be pushed to GitHub prior to the end of each shift.
