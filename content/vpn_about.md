#VPN'S

VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network", it offers the possibility of extending a private network onto a public network or the internet. (Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network#Security_mechanisms)

There are many reasons to use a VPN. If you want a more secure exchange or authentification (using a password and username) when using the internet a VPN would be a good addition.

The more common or well known reason for using a VPN is when you are abroad. If you try to browse certain USA sites in England you may recieve an error message letting you know you do not have ther permission to browse these pages.

If you are in a country with strong restrictions on internet usage such as the use of a firewall in China a VPN can provide the solution to your browsing.
The VPN would allow you the access to the restricted internet pages such as Facebook in China as it would be linking your computer to a server in a different country and would thus allow you to browse the internet as if you were in that different country.

Making your own VPN and creating a personalized server is possible but not easy. VPNs are popular and paying a VPN service may be a better less time consuming cost effective solution.
It is important to test which VPN services work in the country you will be travelling to.
