## What is Markdown and Why Do We Use it?


Markdown is a simple language and software tool used by web writers to convert plain text into HTML. It’s widely accepted by According to its creator, John Gruber, the design goal of Markdown “is to make it as readable as possible” – and it is. 

Markdown is the lazy efficient way to write HTML. It allows you to style text into elements such as headers, links, and more by using half the jargon that HTML requires. 

For example, to italicize text in HTML, you would need to wrap the text in tags like this:

	`<i>Italicize this sentence.</i>`

But in Markdown, all you need to do is:

	`*Italicize this sentence.*`

We like to use Markdown because its simplicity makes it readable and accessible by everyone, including those who don’t know a thing about coding. Even for those who are familiar with HTML, using Markdown makes it easy to spot errors
