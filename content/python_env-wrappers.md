## What is a Python virual environment?


### Premise of a wrapper/enviroment:

-The most basic form in essentially a function that is called within a function
    -does not have to be in the same language
    -data formats must both be compatible with one another
-Programs like SWIG can wrap programs for the use automatically
-Programmers want to use wrappers to adapt their own code to code that might not have been written by themselves or their teams
-Useful in writing error checking functions without increasing the length of code by a considerable amount
-Wrapper libraries are light bits of code that convert some interface into a compatible interface for some other program
    -allows for fixing of poor design
    -allows for two sets of code to work together
    -cross language running of programs (useful for web apps, games, etc.)
-An instance is created within the parent code in which the child code is run
    -higher level programs like Java can run lower level programs like R as an instance
    -Java itself runs in a virtual enviroment
        -builds a temporary virtual machine
        -bound by no operating system, whereas other languages required OS specific libraries and code

### Device Wrappers

-Used to make hardware not originally designed for an OS to work
    -running windows drivers in linux
    -using modern hardware on depreciated OS
-For backwards compatibility
