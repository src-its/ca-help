Oracle VM VirtualBox is a virtual machine manager or [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor). A hypervisor is a program capable of simulating one or more independant operating systems by managing resource requests its operating systems make of native hardware. VirtualBox was developed initially by Innotek GmbH, and acquired first by Sun Microsystems in 2008 and the Oracle in 2010.

VirtualBox can be run on the Linux, OS X, Windows, Solaris, and OpenSolaris operating systems, with ports available to FreeBSD and Genode. It can create and manage guest virtual machines running versions and derivations of Windows, Linux, BSD, OS/2, Solaris, Haiku, OSx86. VirtualBox also allows for limited virtualization of OS X guests on Apple hardware.

[Installation instructions are available on the VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html). When installing VirtualBox, ITS recommends that you also install the '[Guest Additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html)' package of device drivers and system applications.
