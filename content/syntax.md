## What is a syntax?

Syntax is the grammar of lingustic expression.  For computer languages, Syntax is a set of rules describing the form of a program, as opposed to semantics which would determine its content. Syntax rules govern if a statements is "correct" in terms of being understandable to the operating system.

Computer syntax can involve the placement of whitespace, program flow, the order in which operator keywords and their objects are written, or any other aspect of how symbols and characters are laid out to create a compilable/executable program.
