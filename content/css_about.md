## What is CSS?

*CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets*

CSS was made to stylize documents written in any markup language, and separate the document's content from its presentation. More specifically, it is a language that is designed to describe how the elements of a document are displayed. It is most often used for HTML and XHTML, however, we will be using it with Markdown, in order to form our pages in a more orderly manner. 

### Pros

The fact that CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation brings a lot of benefits. For example, it improves the content accessibility with the removal of HTML tables that were used before CSS. These tables made accessibility more diffuclt for users that were visually-impaired.

CSS also makes page reformatting easier. With the minimization of coding through the use of CSS, you can change one line and in turn have an entire different style sheet for the same page. You can change a page or site to adapt to different device screens, and it will still display on devices that can't understand the styling. 

With CSS, the stylesheets for pages and sites can be internal or external. They specfy the style *once* for a range of classified elements. External stylesheets tend to be stored in the browser cache making it possible to use them on multiple pages without having to reload, also saving data usage/bandwidth.

CSS has the capability to hold a global style sheet that can be used to style elements site-wide, thus making great consistency between the pages of the site. If any changes are desired, it only requires a change on the global style sheet. Before CSS, the process was much more tedious.
