## What is CSS?

*CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets*

CSS is a formatting and styling language that describeS how the elements of a document are displayed. CSS can be applied to documents written in any markup language, but is most often used for HTML and XHTML. Use of CSS allows for separation the document's content from its presentation.[^wikipedia] 

### What are the Pros of Using CSS?

<!-- Are there any 'cons' of using CSS? -->

Enforcing the separation of content and presentation helps top improve content accessibility, such as by eliminating style definiations (as had to be applied within an HTML table before CSS).

CSS also makes page reformatting easier. That is, CSS style sheets allow for uniform refortting and re-application of style definitions from a single source file (rather than having to enter the change a each instance of a formatting element).

<!-- Can you give an example in code of how this works? -->

CSS also helps to accomodate the adaptation of content appearance for different device screens, and it will still display on devices that don't understand the styling. 

### How to Use and Apply CSS?

With CSS, the stylesheets for pages and sites can be internal or external. They specify the style *once* for a range of classified elements. External stylesheets tend to be stored in the browser cache making it possible to use them on multiple pages without having to reload, also saving data usage/bandwidth.

CSS has the capability to hold a global style sheet that can be used to style elements site-wide, thus being consistency between the pages of the site. If any changes are desired, it only requires a change on the global style sheet. Before CSS, the process was much more tedious.
