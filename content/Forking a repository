##How to fork a repository

A fork is a copy of another repository this means it leaves the original repository unchanged.
The main reason to fork a repository is to propose changes to someone elses project especially if you are not be part of the main team. 
Otherwise, you can use forking to use someone else's source code and help build up on it using your own ideas and code.

When you click on "Fork" for a specific repository, you are creating an instantaneous copy of that repository at that time point, thus if you have forked a repository and it is later changed those changes are not updated on your forked repository.
If you want to keep updating you fork, with the main repository, then you have to use the "fetch" command.

If you are using terminal and you are pushing to your fork, only your fork will be updated. 
If you want the changes you made to your fork to also be included in the main repository, then after you fork, you must go into the main repository in GitHub, and create a pull request. 
The owner of that repository will then take a look at your pull request and decide whether to keep it or not.
