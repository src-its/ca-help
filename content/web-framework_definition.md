## What is a 'web framework'?

A web framework, also called a web application framework, is a type of framework that allows the building of web enabling applications.  It is is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs. Web frameworks aim to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development by providing set of libraries that do common tasks.[^wikipedia] As many tools are designed to work together, a web framework allows you to call on these tools and resources without having to first write about thier class of object, or otherwise specifying their behavior. Libraries include tools accessing a database, managing sessions and cookies, etc. They allow for rapid templating of HTML and in general and promote the reuse of code.

### Interacting with a web framework:

The client (your browser) requests data from a web application (html, css, etc). The web application in turn responds to the request with an answer (a computation) which it downloads it from the web server using the http protocol.
