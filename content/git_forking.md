## How to fork a repository

A fork is a copy of another repository this means it leaves the original repository unchanged.

The main reason to fork a repository is to propose changes to someone elses project especially if you are not be part of the main team.

Otherwise, use forking to take someone else's source code and help build on it, using your own code and ideas.

When you click on "Fork" for a specific repository, you instantly create a copy of that repository.  Thus, if you have forked a repository and it is later changed, those changes are not updated on your forked repository.

If you want to keep updating you fork along with the main repository, you will have to use the "fetch" command.

If you are using terminal and you are pushing to your fork, only your fork will be updated.

If you want the changes you made to your fork to also be included in the main repository, then after you fork, you must go into the main repository in GitHub and create a pull request.

The owner of that repository will then take a look at your pull request and decide whether to keep it or not.
