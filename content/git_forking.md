##How to fork a repo

A fork is simply just a copy of another repository. It can be when you want to propose changes to someone elses project, when you might not be part of the main team. Otherwise, you can use forking to use someone else's sources and help build up on them using your own ideas for yourself.

When you click on "Fork" for a specific repository, you are creating an instantaneous copy of that repository at that time. All later changes that are commited to that repository are not updated to your fork as well. If you want to keep updating you fork, with the main repository, then you have to use the "fetch" command.

If you are using terminal and you are pushing to your fork, only your fork will be updated. If you want the changes you made to your fork, to also be included in the main repository, then after you fork, you must go into the main repository in GitHub, and create a pull request. Then the owner of that repository will take a look at your pull request and decide whether to keep it or not.
