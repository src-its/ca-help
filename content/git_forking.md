A fork is an independent copy of a repository. As opposed to [cloning](/content/git_cloning.md), a forks acts as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy.[^git-guides_forking]

One might wish to fork a repository if one wishes to make independent, customized changes to someone elses work or when you are not a permitted developer for a given repository.

When you fork a repository, any subsequent changes to the original repository will not be reflected in your fork until issuing a "fetch" command. If you want the changes you made to your fork, to also be included in the main repository, then after you fork, you must go into the main repository in GitHub, and create a pull request.
