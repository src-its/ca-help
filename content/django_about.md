What is Django (and what distinguishes it from other web frameworks)?

Django is a python web framework. Django, like other web frameworks, streamlines the process of developing web applications. Web applications generally require a web server gateway interface, routing, templates, and a host of other things. Django is a collection of libraries that handles those requirements so that you can focus on the application itself. It's widely supported and used by companies like Bitbucket, NASA, Pintrest, Instagram, and Mozilla. Because of it's wide support, there are many existing third party libraries for things like user registration, imaging, scientific calculations, etcthat you can include with ease to avoid reinventing the wheel.
