## What is a language?

<!-- AKD note: We start on Header L2 b/c site title occupies L1 position on page. -->

Formally, a language is just a set of valid strings as determined by some rule.

Computer languages are formal languages that can be described in concrete terms and which adhere rigidly to rules. The rules of computer languages must all be explicitly defined in order to convey meaning between two systems. Computer programming languages such as Java, Python, or C++, are simply collections of rules for valid expressions of meaning within a bounded context (i.e. the interaction of programs). 

Spoken and written human languages can be viewed as far less 'formal' in the sense that words can convey a specific, shared meaning even where they are not formally defined.  For example, to obtain valid three-letter English words, one could work through a dictionary compiling the strings "bat", "cat", "the", "too", etc. In a formal sense, this list of strings is a language - but in a human sense it's largely meaningless. Human languages are constantly adding and removing new vocabulary and phraseology while formal languages are restricted to the defining rule set. 

<!--Depending on the size, thoroughness and objective of those compiling the dictionary, however, this exercise might not provide a comprehensive collection of valid strings; words like "ooh" and "ahh", for example, might be missing. Similarly, cultural phenomenon can lead to the spontaneous creation of new words and expressions, such as the recent prominence of words in American English like "amazeballs" and phrases like "totes adorbs". -->
 
The meaning conveyed by terms and expressions change and evolve as people use them differently.

Computer languages are formal languages in that all rules of interaction are defined. Java, for instance, is means of expressing statements for compilable Java programs, or the programs which adhere Java's syntactic and semantic ruleset&mdash;all statements end with a semicolon, all variables are defined before being used, etc. 

<!-- This could be elaborated. -->

Computer languages behave like human languages in that clear communication depends on how both the "speaker" and the "listener" send and receive information. HTML for instance uses tags like `<p>`, `<a>`, or `<ul>` to give context to text following that tag, but leaves the specifics of how such text might be displayed or handled to the browser.  Thus, browsers that have different fonts for expressing typeface will render the same page differently.


#### types of computer languages

A programming language is used to issue commands to a computer.

A markup language is used to provide semantic information about a document. 

<!-- I'm pretty sure the below is untrue. There might be some confusion but the distinction between a mark-up language and programming language is formal enough that there isn't debate. -->

<!--  For example, there is some debate about whether Java and HTML are considered a 'markup language' or a 'programming language'. -->

### human languages

In everyday conversation, "language" refers to human languages. 

There is no 'right' way to speak a human language. There is no 'proper' English that is more English than any other English. Formal rules may be designed and intended to facilitate shared expression. <!-- This paragraph needs some further revisions and links in the text to different references (especially statements).  -->
